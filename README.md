If you got any error of CORS while fetching data and consuming rest api on front end side.

Error like ----> "CORS POLICY No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on request"

Solution -----> This may happen because google chrome somtimes not allow all api to fetch for security purpose.
                so, you have to enable the cors-anywhere so, then you won't get any error like 404 while fetching the data.
                
                So, you just need to install the extension in google chrome.
