If you got any error of CORS while fetching data and consuming rest api on front end side.

Error like ----> "CORS POLICY No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on request"
                                                  OR
                 "Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:9090/api/v1/employees' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-                      Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."


Solution -----> This may happen because google chrome somtimes not allow all api to fetch for security purpose.
                so, you have to enable the cors-anywhere so, then you won't get any error like 404 while fetching the data.
                
                So, you just need to install the extension in google chrome.
                here is the link to download and install it.
